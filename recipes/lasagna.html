    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We took a couple shortcuts for this recipe by using store-bought marinara 
        and boxed pasta sheets. It saves a ton of time without sacrificing any flavor. 
        We think it's absolutely perfect as-is, but also understand some people are 
        looking to make sauce from scratch. Use our best homemade spaghetti sauceâ€”it'll 
        never let you down. </p>
